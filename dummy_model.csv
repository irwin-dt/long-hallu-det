0,What does the first clue say?,,"The first clue says: ""People Passion Innovation"""
1,What is the 2nd clue?,,"The second clue is: ""People Passion Innovation."""
2,What is Clue #3?,,"Clue #3 is hidden within the description of DSO National Laboratories and Science Centre Singapore, mentioning their roles and capabilities. The phrase ""People Passion Innovation"" appears as part of the organization's profile, hinting at a name or slogan. By examining the provided excerpts, we can't find a direct mention of a slogan or motto containing exactly ""People Passion Innovation."" However, looking at the structure of the documents, we notice repeated mentions of DSO and SCS, possibly representing the acronym or initials for their full titles, Department of Scientific Organizations and Centers of Science and Safety.

Given the format of the articles and the hints provided, it's plausible that ""People Passion Innovation"" is meant to symbolize something related to the departments involved in organizing the Singapore Amazing Flying Machine Competition, perhaps as their catchphrase or theme. But strictly speaking, none of the texts explicitly confirm this phrase as their official slogan or motto. There seems to be a discrepancy between the search for the clue and what's actually present in the documents. If there's supposed to be a match elsewhere or if we're overlooking a subtle inclusion, we'd need to revisit the materials or consider that this might be a trick clue and check for alternative interpretations."
